File issues in Github
=====================

In general all enhancements or bugs should be tracked via github issues before
PRs are submitted. We don't require them, but it'll help us plan and track.

When submitting bugs through issues, please try to be as descriptive as
possible. It'll make it easier and quicker for everyone if the developers can
easily reproduce your bug.
