# How the Omnibot website and docs are updated

1. The docs are published
   to [docs/omnibot/latest](https://github.com/lyft/omnibot.github.io/tree/master/docs/omnibot/latest)
   on every commit to master. This process is handled by Travis with the
   [`publish.sh`](https://github.com/lyft/omnibot/blob/master/docs/publish.sh) script.

2. The docs are published to [docs/omnibot](https://github.com/lyft/omnibot.github.io/tree/master/docs/omnibot)
   in a directory named after every tagged commit in this repo. Thus, on every tagged release there
   are snapped docs.
